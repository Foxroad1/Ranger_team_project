Data Privacy and Security Statement

As a private individual managing this project,
I am committed to ensuring that user data is handled securely and responsibly.

Here are the measures I have implemented:

1. Data Handling:
User data is strictly processed within,
the web server and its companion Android app.
No data is transferred outside these environments.

2. Access Control:
Only authorized personnel, such as server administrators and HR staff,
have access to user data.
Personal worker profiles cannot view or interact with other user profiles.

3. Data Protection:
All personal information is stored securely and is not shared with third parties,
including Google, Microsoft, or any other companies.

4. Certificates and Compliance:
The system is designed to comply with relevant data protection regulations,
including GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).
While this is a school project, I have considered the importance of certifications,
such as SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.

5. Data Security Practices:
Basic Security Practices:
The database is protected by a password and the admin username can be changed.
Basic security measures, such as the Windows firewall, are in place to protect the system.

Note point 5:

    Note for point 5:
    "If this software and app were to be released into a real-life environment,
    such as for a company to purchase and use, we would consider implementing stronger,
     protections. This would include ensuring server security,
     encryption, and a robust third-party firewall setup."
